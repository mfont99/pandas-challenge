Report:

- 15 school districts
- 39170 students
- total budget: $24,649,428
- average math score for entire district: 78.99
- average reading score for entire district: 81.88
- district pass rate for math: 74.98%
- district pass rate for reading: 85.81%
- district pass rate for math and reading: 65.17%

Created a dataframe summarizing the above values.

The following values were calculated for each school:

- the type of school (district or charter)
- number of students
- budget
- budget per student
- average math score
- average reading score
- pass rate for math
- pass rate for reading
- pass rate for math and reading

Created a dataframe summarizing the above values with the school names as the index.

Created smaller dataframes that sorted the schools by their overall passing percentage.

- one dataframes sorted by highest passing percentage (top schools)
- the other dataframe sorted by lowest passing percentage (bottom schools)

Created a dataframe that directly compared each grade of students (9th - 12th) with their math scores, for each school.
Created a dataframe that directly compared each grade of students (9th - 12th) with their reading scores, for each school.

Created an extra column for spending ranges per student. This was done with data slicing and bins.
Using this new column, created a new dataframe that focused only on the spending ranges per student and what their corresponding scores/pass
rates are.

Added yet another column to the original dataframe to include school size and then created another dataframe comparing the students'
scores/pass rates based on the size of the school (number of students).

Lastly,  the same thing as above was done with the type of school, effectively comparing students' scores/pass rates with the type of school
(district or charter).



Conclusions:

1. Charter schools have significantly higher scores pass rates for both math and english. 

2. The largest schools (between 2000-5000 students) see a significant decrease in their pass rates

3. The percentage of students passing math, reading, and both actually seems to be inversely proportional to the spending per student
(would want more data to confirm, seems like a weird conclusion).

4. There doesn't seem to be any correlation between scores and the grades of the students.
