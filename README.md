# pandas-challenge
Module 4 challenge assignment

Most the coding for this assignment was my own. I got some syntax from official documentation, and other syntax from the AI. 

Only site I used for help was https://stackoverflow.com/questions/37787698/how-to-sort-pandas-dataframe-by-one-column.

Aside from that, the AI was used mostly as a debugging tool.
